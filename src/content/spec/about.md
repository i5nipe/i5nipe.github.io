Welcome to my blog! I'm **i5nipe**, a cybersecurity enthusiast with a passion for diving into the world of Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions and exploring the latest in cyber defense techniques.

### What I Do

In addition to participating in CTFs, I enjoy coding and developing tools that can aid in cybersecurity research and operations. One of my notable projects is **nipejs**, a tool written in Go that you can find on my [GitHub](https://github.com/i5nipe/nipejs).
